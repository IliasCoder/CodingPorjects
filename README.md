# 🚀 Personal Projects Hub

Welcome to my **Personal Projects Repository**!  
This repo is a growing collection of my self-initiated, experimental, and practice projects—ranging from frontend interfaces and backend systems to AI experiments, scripting tools, and everything in between.

Whether it's a small script to automate something useful or a full-stack application built with passion, you'll find it all here.

## 📁 Structure

Each project is organized in its own folder and includes:

- `README.md` — Quick overview of the project.
- `src/` or main code files.
- Any required assets, documentation, or demo links.

## 🧪 Work in Progress

This repository is **always evolving**.  
I'm constantly learning, and whenever I try something new, I push it here—sometimes polished, sometimes raw, but always part of the journey.

Feel free to browse around, open issues, or suggest ideas!
